RegexBlocker is an iOS app and Safari Web Extension that allows you to block websites using custom regular expressions. Your privacy is very important to us, and this policy explains how we handle your data.

## Information We Collect

RegexBlocker does **not** collect, store, or share any personal information.

- All regular expression patterns you create are stored **locally on your device** in secure app storage (using Apple's App Group container).
- If you enable password protection, your password is stored securely in the iOS Keychain, which is managed by Apple.

RegexBlocker does not use analytics, tracking, or external servers.

## Data Sharing

RegexBlocker does **not** share any data with third parties.  
No information is sent over the internet — all functionality happens locally on your device.

---

## Security

- Patterns are stored locally in a sandboxed app group container.
- If you set a password, it is stored in the iOS Keychain and cannot be accessed by other apps.

## Children’s Privacy
