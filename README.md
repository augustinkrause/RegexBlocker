# RegexBlocker
An iOS Safari extension to block URLs based on JavaScript regular expressions.

This is an iOS Safari extension that lets you block URLs based on JavaScript Regular Expressions (Regexes). Regexes are a powerful tool that allow you to create custom and complex rules to block URLs based on certain criteria. The use of them is explained within the app, with links to further documentation. Users can edit the current blocking rules both from within the app, and within the extension pop-up in Safari itself.
The app can additionally be password protected. If password protection is set up, editing the blocking rules is no longer possible from the pop-up in Safari. Editing is then only possible from within the app, after it has been unlocked with the password.
